# To ignore the icon hidden file added by Mac OS X when the folder has a custom icon,
# instead of "Icon?" or "Icon\r", add TWO (sic) CRLF control characters.
# (From http://blog.bitfluent.com/post/173740409/ignoring-icon-in-gitignore)
# In vi(m) type CTRL-V + CTRL-M to insert one CRLF control character.
# Those control characters will then appear in vim as "^M" in blue color to indicate that they are invisible.
